# Codex NFT Project - Community Art Contribution Guide
The first NFT project on Codex.

## About the Project

We're creating a special NFT collection of 100 tokens based on one unique artwork design to honor our testnet users who have been instrumental in Codex's journey. This single artwork will embody the core principles that make Codex powerful:

- Privacy
- Censorship Resistance
- Data Durability

This is more than just an art project â€“ it's a celebration of digital freedom and the technology that protects it.
