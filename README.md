# Codex NFT Project - Community Art Contribution Guide
The first NFT project on Codex.

## About the Project

We're creating a special collection of 100 unique NFTs to honor our testnet users who have been instrumental in Codex's journey. These NFTs will embody the core principles that make Codex powerful:

- Privacy
- Censorship Resistance
- Data Durability

This is more than just an art project – it's a celebration of digital freedom and the technology that protects it.

## Call for Artists

We're seeking talented artists from our community to help bring this vision to life. Whether you're a digital artist, illustrator, or designer, if you're passionate about privacy and digital rights, we want to collaborate with you!

## Artwork Guidelines

### Theme and Style
- Each piece should creatively interpret one or more of our core themes
- Art style is open but should maintain consistency across the collection
- Artwork can be abstract, representational, or a mix of both
- Consider incorporating elements that represent:
  - Data protection and privacy (e.g., shields, keys, encrypted messages)
  - Resistance to censorship (e.g., broken chains, birds in flight)
  - Data durability (e.g., vaults, digital fortresses)

### Technical Requirements
- Final artwork dimensions: 3000x3000 pixels
- Format: PNG or SVG with transparent background
- Color space: RGB
- File size: Maximum 20MB per artwork
